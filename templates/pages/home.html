            <h4>What is full stack development?</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>Full stack development encompasses the complete process of application software development,
                including both the front-end and back-end development. The front end consists of the user interface
                (or UI), and the back end handles the business logic and application workflows that run behind the
                scenes.
                Full stack developers possess the skills and knowledge to work across the entire technology stack,
                enabling seamless user experiences and developing robust backends.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>A full-stack developer is a software developer who is proficient in both frontend and backend development. This
                means they can work on the entire technology stack of a web application, from designing user interfaces to
                managing databases and server-side logic.

    <h2>FRONT-END DEVELOPER</h2>

        <div class="front-end">
            <h4>What is a Front-end developer?</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>A frontend developer focuses on the client-side of web applications, meaning everything that users interact
                with directly in their browsers. Their main goal is to create a visually appealing, responsive, and
                user-friendly experience.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The front end is the face of a web application, the part that users interact with directly. Full stack web
                developers possess a deep understanding of front-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They
                leverage these foundational languages to structure, style, and enhance the visual appeal of web pages.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Full stack developers also stay current with the ever-evolving front-end landscape, constantly exploring and
                mastering the latest technologies and frameworks. Whether it's harnessing the power of React to build
                dynamic and interactive user interfaces, leveraging Angular's robust features for complex web applications,
                or embracing the simplicity and flexibility of Vue.js, full stack web developers are well-versed in a wide
                range of tools.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Full stack developers understand the importance of creating responsive designs that seamlessly adapt to
                various devices and screen sizes. They employ CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation to streamline the
                development process and ensure a consistent and visually appealing user interface across different
                platforms.
            </p>

    <h2>BACK-END DEVELOPER</h2>
    <div class="section back-end">
        <div>
            <h4>What is a Back-End Developer?</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>Full stack developers are proficient in server-side languages such as Python, Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript,
                allowing them to build robust and scalable back-end systems. Back-end developers play a crucial role in
                designing and implementing the application's core functionality, handling data management, and ensuring
                smooth integration with databases like MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL.
    
                Additionally, they possess the skills to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code that powers the
                application's back-end logic. Whether it's Python's simplicity and versatility, Ruby's elegance and
                readability, PHP's widespread adoption, or Node.js's event-driven architecture, full stack developers are
                well-versed in multiple programming languages and can choose the best fit for the project at hand.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Back-end development â€” more than just writing code
                Back-end development involves more than just writing code. Full stack developers have a keen understanding
                of server architecture and API development. They design and implement RESTful APIs that enable seamless
                communication between the front-end and back-end components of the application. By creating well-structured
                and documented APIs, they facilitate easy integration and ensure that the front-end developers can
                efficiently interact with the back-end services.</p>
